And another person who protested, was Howard Hughes, who owns most of Las Vegas at this point, and had his own reasons for protesting. These protests did not stop the testing. The test was made. It was the largest underground made yet. Do you know this story? There was a crack, a crack in the earth, big enough, they said, the way we talk, big enough for the Empire State Building."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Muriel Rukeyser"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Speaking"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Transcription"}],"uuid":"298d0e21-2640-4260-a2b4-44f089b6ecf8"},{"start_time":106260,"end_time":106260,"annotation":[{"0":{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},"children":[{"text":"Audience laughter"}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Audience"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Situated"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Notes"}],"uuid":"e42729f0-7a8c-4018-aeb1-273d8a5dccab"},{"start_time":107760,"end_time":111120,"annotation":[{"0":{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},"children":[{"text":"There's a crack there, and deep under the crust there's a three foot crack of some kind, and the rocks are still falling, and they say there will be earthquakes in various parts, unpredictable parts of the world as a result of the shift of the under-crust.

It's part of the ways in which we are bound to each other. I'll give you that. In Mexico, we are bound under the ground, over the ground, in every way there is. In Mexico, though the stories of what really happened to the students in October, and the stories of people-- of many students --were killed and the police were among the crowd, and the police wore one white glove or tied a handkerchief around their right hand, and when the helicopters came over, these white hands were put up that said \"don't shoot us, we're police.\" Many students were shot, and they say in Mexico City that the bodies were incinerated, and no reports were made and no count was made. And these are the ways in which we are bound, too. And yes, I have been translating Octavio Paz, and Eikelof is another such poet, but Paz--the end of one of Octavio's poems--was printed on this issue of the University Student's Journal of the University of Mexico, with the account of September, October, November, December. And the poem ends like this in English. It's not as good, I warn you, these translations are a folly on a madness on a stupidity and at the same time one has to do it. As work to which one is driven, out of love and gratitude, and also out a motive not so noble as any of that. During the times in which one cannot write poems, it is wonderful to have something one cares about out in front of one, and work with it that way. And it's the thing, not spinning out of oneself in those times, but having something out in front. This is the end of the- of a great poem of Octavio Paz's called \"A Broken Jar.â And jar, of course--water jar--is something quite different in Mexico. We say 'jar,' 'jug,' something like that. It isn't in the thing we use every day, in Mexico, it's every day; it's that kind of broken jar."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Muriel Rukeyser"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Speaking"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Transcription"}],"uuid":"838aebfd-f3bd-485b-a025-e061849ec86a"},{"start_time":120960,"end_time":124140,"annotation":[{"0":{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},"children":[{"text":"Reads \"A Broken Jar\" (by Octavio Paz)"}]}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Muriel Rukeyser"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Reading"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Notes"}],"uuid":"764a2198-6523-4fbc-a630-7cdb1554bc89"},{"start_time":124620,"end_time":124620,"annotation":[{"0":{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},"children":[{"text":"These are some poems, since my last book, and I don't know whether they are finished.
